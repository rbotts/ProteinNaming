<p>Our overall goal is to have a tool to help us identify plasmid backbone proteins that are similar proteins with the different names and different proteins with the same name.  Identifying these will help us to rectify the naming of these genes and will ultimately better allow us to apply the nomenclature system proposed in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plasmid.2017.03.006">"Annotation of plasmid genes."</a>
</p>

<p>We define similar to be 70% identity and 70% coverage.  Proteins from all coding genes and all completely sequenced plasmids in Genbank were extracted and grouped into classes, called clusters or protein families, satisfying this definition of similarity.  Note that it is possible that two sequences within the same faily may have less than 70% coverage or identity due to the presence of intermediates.  That is, if protein A is similar to protein B, by this definition and protein B is similar to protein C, then even though protein A may not be directly similar to protein C, via similarity to B, both A and C have been placed in the same cluster.</p>

<p>The collection of well-studied plasmids in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plasmid.2017.03.006">"Annotation of plasmid genes,"</a> representing each of the major incompatibility groups is used to reference standard examples of various genes, e.g. the Ssb protein from plasmid F from the incF plasmids.  These references allow us to identify clusters of proteins where the function is presumably known, as opposed to clusters where there are no reference plasmids and it is not clear as to whether there is sufficient evidence to identify protein function.  Ultimately, we would hope that as novel plasmids are characterized additional clusters can be classified within the defined nomenclature system.</p>

<p>Additionally, in an effort to identify families of proteins commonly associated with a given incompatibility group, 90 plasmids with known incompatibility groups used in (cite) were identified in our database and allow us to identify families of proteins associated with a given incompatibility group.</p>

<p>This tool will allow us to help identify and quantify the places where backbone gene annotations are inconsistent in the database.  There are two primary types of inconsistancies we aim to identify: 1) sequences with an inferred functional similarity based on sequence identity and different names and 2) sequences with different function, but the same name.  </p>

<p>The tool aims to provide information on clusters of similar proteins, evolutionary relationships between different clusters, and relationships between the backbone portions of the the complete plasmid backbones.</p>
