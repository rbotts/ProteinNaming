Summary
</h3>

<p>
1. Representative sequences (centroids) from each protein family were selected for each backbone protein.
</p>

<p>
2. The representative sequences for each backbone protein were muscle-aligned 
using the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/msa.html"><b>msa</b></a> package in R.
</p>

<p>
3. Phylogenetic trees were computed on the alignments using the
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape/index.html"><b>ape</b></a> package in R.
